### webRTC-chat
===========


WebRTC-chat is a Video chat implemented using the new web techonlogy called WebRTC. It is a clone of https://apprtc.appspot.com, but with some differences. 
The singnaling server is implemented using node.js and socke.io. 

The only goal of this project is to learn the webRTC technology. 

I want to augment the apprtc prototype with the following feautures : 

  - Support text chat 
  - Support an arbitrary number of users. 

##Note : 

The project is under development and at the current stage the major feautures are not implemented yet.
