webRTC-chat
===========

WebRTC-chat is a Video chat implemented using the new web techonlogy called WebRTC. 
It is a clone of https://apprtc.appspot.com, implemented used node.js and socket.io. 
The only goal of this project is to learn the webRTC techonology. 

I want to augument the apprtc with the following feautures : 
  
  - Support text chat. 
  - Support an arbitrary number of users. 


Note : 

The project is under development and currently the major feautures are not implemented yet.
